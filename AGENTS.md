# Agent Instructions

- Use `just` targets to manage the virtual environment and dependencies.
- Run tests via `just test` (or more targeted `just test -- <args>` when appropriate).
- Use `just streamlit` to run the Streamlit app.
- Execute implementation plans in this session by default (subagent-driven). Do not ask for execution mode unless explicitly requested.
